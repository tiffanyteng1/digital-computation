// To test this, I entered the value 100. I was able to find a chart online about prime numbers under 100 to check the given values from my program. The only number under 100 that is panlindromic is 11 which would be correct. I checked all the ones that said it had an odd sum to verify the odd sum function
    //  I tested multiple numbers like :
        // 19: 2 is a prime number , 3 is a prime number and has an odd sum, 5 is a prime number and has an odd sum, 7 is a prime number and has an odd sum, 11 is a prime number and is palindromic, 13 is a prime number, 17 is a prime number, 19 is a prime number
        // since it was more difficult to to check the larger values, I checked random prime numbers, with symbolab,  and the palindromic and odd sums on paper to see if was correct
//it will work correctly  for the number of digits/bits that an int can hold, which can be fixed by using a long int
// efficiency is dependent on the user, for me over 1m of output seemed long and inefficient,
        //over about 180000 took over 1m to output
